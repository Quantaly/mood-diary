# mood-diary

A simple mood diary with a daily slider between -5 and 5 and a place to type whatever. The psychiatrist recommended some printouts for me and I couldn't be bothered to print something out. Or to do research on programs that existed. This is what I am transitioning to off of literally LibreOffice Base (knockoff Access) as my diary for the past few days.
